(To be released.)

NEW:
  - Some audio setting defaults were changed for OSX. Exclusive audio mode is disabled by
    default, and the "Channels" option is now set to "auto" by default.
    This does not affect existing installations, unless you delete or reset your
    PMP config file.
  - Removed the "Advanced" checkbox in the audio settings. PMP now behaves the same as if
    "Advanced" was always enabled in previous versions.
  - Added a new "copy-back" hardware decoding setting. Useful only in specific situations.

FIXED:
  - Fix screensaver behavior. In particular, the screensaver should now also start before
    any videos were played.
  - (Embedded) Fix performance regression on RPI
  - Subtitle selection for vobsubs with multiple stream should now finally work
  - Fix rate display mode auto switching with imprecise media FPS values values like 24.999
