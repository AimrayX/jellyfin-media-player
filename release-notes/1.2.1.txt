NEW:
 - Desktop web-client updated to 2.12.5
 - TV web-client updated
 - Multimedia keys (play, next, prev) now work in desktop mode
 - Changes to mode switching. There is now a new setting called "layout"
   which can be set to "tv" or "auto". Auto will behave as 1.2.0 and
   switch to TV mode when in fullscreen. Set this to TV to "lock" the 
   tv layout and not automatically switch to desktop mode. This can
   also be set by adding --tv to the command line.
 - Added new command line switch to control the scale factor of the UI --scale-factor=X
 - New subtitle color added
 - Automatic subtitle encoding detection on MacOS and Linux

FIXES:
 - (Desktop) Prevent screensaver during video/photo playback
 - (Desktop) Respect video quality setting
 - Support for HiDPI mode on Linux and Windows. Note that windows
   currently only work on integer values. I.e. 1/2/3 not 1.25 or 1.5.
   If you want something more granular use the --scale-factor=1.25 command
   line switch.
 - Various playback related fixes
